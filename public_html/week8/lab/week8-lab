1. Create a new Lab8.html file under your week 8 folder.  
    Create a Div and 3 buttons on the page.
    Button 1: Fade in
    Button 2: Fade out
    Button 3: Move Div
    Make sure to give the buttons ID's so you can add an event handler to them.

2. Create an alert message using the alert function
(alert is a built in JavaScript global function) 
that will display after the page has been open for 5 seconds.
use:  alert('hi');

3. Use a timer to run a function that will fade out a div.
hint: Elem.style.opacity
    opacity can only take a number between 0 and 1
    To make it simple it should fade in only 10 steps.
    10 / 100

4. Create another function that will fade in the same div.
Hint: you should cancel the previous timer before starting this one
    
5.  Create a function that will move the div across the screen.
hint:  Set the div to be "position: absolute;" in CSS.  
    in JavaScript you can update the elem.style.left property
    to increase the position by 10 pixels each time it's run.
    e.g.
    var divPosLeft = 0;
    
    divPosLeft = divPosLeft + 10;
    elem.style.left = divPosLeft+"px";
