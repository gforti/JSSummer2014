                We will be creating a canvas race game. We will have two teams, one red and the other blue, that will race to the finish line.

                Using Canvas create two rectangles, one red and the other blue. They should be the same width and height. 
                When moving the rectangles make sure to generate a random number to move the x position of each rectangle. 
                The minimum should always be greater than zero. It should be called twice to get a unique number for each rectangle. 
                Once the rectangle reaches the finish line, display the winner. A play button should appear to reset the race. 
                Once the race is started the play button should be hidden again.
